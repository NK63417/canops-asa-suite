# ðŸ§  CanOps ASA Suite
**Canadian Operations Application Support Analyst Suite**

A simulated **incident management toolkit** inspired by real-world ASA (Application Support Analyst) workflows in Canadian enterprise environments (RBC, TD, CGI, etc.).  
This suite automates **log parsing, severity classification, incident window analysis, and SLA reporting** â€” bridging the gap between traditional IT support and Python-based automation.

## ðŸš€ Live Mission
**Objective:**  
Demonstrate end-to-end ASA capabilities through automation:
- Parse and triage application logs.  
- Classify incidents (SEV1â€“SEV4) by severity.  
- Summarize health metrics from live logs.  
- Simulate ServiceNow-style incident workflows.
